# Open Leadership Zone
This is open to any project in [Mozilla Open Leaders round 4](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/round-4/projects/) -- even if you're not coming to MozFest. This process ensures that you're following open practices and will help set you up for a sustained contributor community afterwards. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to @acabunoc or ask questions in our [chat room](http://gitter.im/mozilla/open-leadership-training).
